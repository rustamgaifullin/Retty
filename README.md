**Description**

Retty it's a demonstration of how to implement simple RESTful server without any additional libraries (almost)

Server implementation based on ServerSocket from J2SE.
So far supports only basic POST request, simple context building using few annotations for describing controllers and basic logger to console.


Place to take a look first:  
[Retty integration test](https://github.com/rustamgaifullin/Retty/blob/master/src/test/java/com/rm/retty/integration/RettyIntegrationTest.java)


**Plans**

In future I'm going to convert Retty to Kotlin and implement basic GET method.

PS. Maybe simple demonstration can become something big...who knows...
